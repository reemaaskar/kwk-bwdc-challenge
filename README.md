## README & Credits
This project was developed for the KWK x BWDC Scrollytelling Challenge to explore how digital access and opportunity impact Black communities across the U.S. Through data storytelling, animated visuals, and web interactivity, it aims to make complex disparities more understandable, and more actionable.

## Sources & Data
All figures and insights are based on verified sources including:

- Pew Research Center
- U.S. Census Bureau
- National Science Foundation
- OECD (2020)
- National Skills Coalition
- Bureau of Labor Statistics
- McKinsey & Company
- Black Wealth Data Center
- Direct references and citations are provided next to each visual or quote.

## Code & Web Development Tools
Hover definitions: Code adapted from Imran Siddiq – Web Squadron

Scroll-triggered animations: Based on the video "Effortlessly Create Scroll Animations with the Intersection Observer API"

Scrollytelling structure: Adapted from Jasmine Samra’s open-source template for the KWK x BWDC challenge

Chart creation: Highcharts used for interactive visualisations. Chart configuration (e.g., stacking/grouping) was refined using scripting support and data formatting tools to streamline development.

## Narrative Refinement & Debugging Support
Refinements to narrative flow and visual storytelling were made with the help of AI (ChatGPT-4), used sparingly to polish phrasing, clarify transitions, and support unfamiliar coding issues during development. All content was written with original intent and voice, and reviewed for factual accuracy and relevance to sourced research.
