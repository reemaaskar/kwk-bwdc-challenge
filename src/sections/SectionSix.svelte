      But access is only one part of the equation. <strong
        >Without reliable broadband, Black students are disconnected from
        foundational learning opportunities, before they even reach the
        classroom.</strong
      > From remote lessons and online homework portals to coding tutorials and math
      help videos, digital tools have become the new gatekeepers of academic success.
    </p>
    <p>
      This technological exclusion compounds over time. <strong
        >When access to learning is unequal, preparation for advanced fields
        like science and technology is too.</strong
      > The result? Fewer Black students enter STEM pipelines, not because of lack
      of interest or talent, but because the digital ground beneath them was never
      level.

      Broadband isn’t just a tech issue, it’s a pipeline issue. One that starts
