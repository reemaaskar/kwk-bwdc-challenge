    <h1>Turning the Digital Divide Into a Digital Bridge</h1>
    <p><strong>This is more than a data story, it’s a call to action. </strong></p>
    <p>Across every chart,
    and statistic, a clear picture emerges: digital access and digital skills are
    foundational to economic justice. Without high-speed internet and meaningful
    opportunities to build tech fluency, Black students are steered away from STEM
    pathways, and Black workers are shut out of some of the fastest-growing, best-paying
    jobs in the U.S. economy. </p>
  
    <p>This isn’t just a technology story, it’s a story
    about unlocking Black potential, economic power, and generational wealth. It’s
    about ensuring every child has the tools not just to participate in the digital
    age, but to lead in it. </p>
    
    <h2>By weaving together national
    insights and community realities, we can reframe the digital divide not as a
    barrier, but as a bridge to Black opportunity. </h2>
